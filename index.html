        <section class="when">
            <h2>When did I first start learning how to code?</h2>
            <p>April 18th, 2022</p>
        </section>

        <section class="previous">
            <h2>Did I have any previous experience?</h2>
            <p>None. I have never studied coding at all before this aside from designing a MySpace profile account by copying and pasting premade templates adding designs and tweaking them to get the desired outcome I wanted.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="start">
            <h2>What made me want to start coding?</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, the desire to better myself and stay productive in my down time. I have always been a productive type of person, one to never enjoy neutral down time. There was a conundrum I kept asking myself that for the longest time I couldn't figure out an answer to and that was- "How can I make more money and give myself a purpose aside from being just an Employee. Eventually the idea of being able to build websites and make apps that could bring in secondary income sounded brilliant! Very little overhead and very little start up fees unlike starting a traditional business front styled business. As I learned more and started to code, I realized I absolutely loved coding. It is so satisfying to see something you envisioned in your mind come to life by your code. Right off the bat I was hooked and knew no matter what it would take this would soon become my life. I've always loved technology and been attracted to it throughout my entire life. I always thought coders were the elite one in a million individuals with the most amazing minds and that this field wasn't for just anyone. I learned that's not the case, you just need dedication and perseverance!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="how">
            <h2>How have I learned to code?</h2>
            <p>I started doing quite a bit of research on google. I pretty much followed a "throw the dart" approach. Meaning- I knew so very little about coding I didn't even know what to search for. Eventually I was able to gain enough random key points of knowledge to build myself a game plan. What to learn, how to learn it, and what to do once I learn it. I decided on CodeCademy using their self-paced lessons. I started their free singular lessons at first and 2 days later I upgraded to their Pro membership that gives you direct learning paths set up in order on when and what to learn in order to achieve a certain goal. I completed their "Learn How to Code Course", "Code Foundation Skill Path", and "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Skill Path". I then signed up for my very first bootcamp. I wanted a more structured and paced environment. I decided on NuCamp and I chose their 11 month Software Engineering bootcamp that consists of 4 individual bootcamps. First being Web Development Fundamentals, I have successfully completed this bootcamp. It taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="next">
            <h2>So... What's next then?</h2>
            <p>I plan to finish NuCamps 11 month bootcamp the second bootcamp is Backend. I start it on June 27th, 2022. It is a 16-week course. Third is the Full stack bootcamp that is a 22-week long course, followed finally by their Career Development 6-week bootcamp to help you learn how to transition into a tech career. It comes with Resume, LinkenIn, and GitHub help. It also provides the opportunity to attend a Hack-A-Thon and numerous other perks. I also plan to simultaneously complete the same areas we go over on CodeCademy. I feel this is the best course of action in order to make sure I have an extremely strong understanding of the fundamentals, no one program is perfect. Learning from different companies and different angles can add a lot because of missed or skipped information. I am also using this method to obtain more certificates to clearly showcase my ambitions, drive, determination, and desire to become a Software Engineer who always tries to achieve for way more than the bare minimum. After completion of the Backend course of my bootcamp I intend to seek out employment from a tech firm as a Junior Backend Developer and continue my program with NuCamp at the same time. I am choosing this route because on the job training is always more useful then just studying alone. I will be able to absorb much more information and become a better well rounded Software Engineer in the process. Once I finish the entire bootcamp I plan to obtain a role as a Junior Software Engineer. Once I stabilize in my new field I intent to continue my college courses to obtain a bachelor's degree in computer science. I hope to one day eventually specialize in AI development as I have always loved and been intrigued by AI. Of course, my actual career path can always change as I experience more platforms, languages, and overall just broaden my understanding of the tech world. I very well may fall in love with a new specialized area and gravitate towards it instead.</p>
